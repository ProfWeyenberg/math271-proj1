[![GitHub Classroom Workflow](../../actions/workflows/classroom.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/classroom.yml)

The project will consist of 

- locating a data set table on a public webpage
- writing a short narrative about the source of the data and what's in it
- scraping and wrangling the data into usable shape
- writing a short methods narrative about the wrangling process
- creating an appropriate visualization of some aspect of the data
- write a short narrative about your visualization 

Each "short narrative" should be about one or two paragraphs. As long as needed, but not longer.

You will complete this project in randomly assigned teams of 2 using a shared github repository. You should

- Open an Issue to discuss and decide on a data set to use.
- Each person should work in a personal branch of the repository. 
- Use pull requests to merge work into the main branch as appropriate.


Minimally viable product (7/10):

- Data is not scraped, (comes from a machine-readable data file).
- Minimal wrangling required to make data usable.
- Data source is cited and a reasonably accurate description is provided. Reader should be able to independently obtain the data based on the description.
- Visualization must have appropriately labeled axes, legends, and titles.
- Narratives should clarify and interpret the code or figures.

Due diligence (8/10):

- Data comes from a human-readable website and requires at least a few wrangling steps to make usable.
- Narratives are free of grammatical and other errors. 
- No distracting and unnecessary text in output files.
- Code adheres to principles of good style.

Diminishing returns (9/10):

- Make a second, non-redundant, visualization and interpret it. 

Polishing the cannonball:

- All visualizations and narratives flow together, giving the reader a non-trivial insight into some aspect of the data.
